Question #1: What's the difference between pro and free?
Free is only for testing purposes and only allows users to input a few products and services.
The PRO version is the rest of the features listed above.

Question #2: My color or fonts not working properly on my pricing table.
1. Try temporarily changing your theme in the theme settings under the Appearance tab. Change your theme to the basic stock theme that WordPress comes standard with and see if this fixes the issue. Do not worry, changing your theme won�t lose any customizations or changes you�ve made.
2. Try investigating if your themes core color settings are interfering or overriding the plugin by seeing it the font and color that is appearing is set somewhere in your theme settings.
3. Are you using Visual Composer, Beaver or any other Page Builders? Make sure the short-code [pricelist id="1494263699"] is placed in the Raw HTML, Site Origin Text Editor, or any other widget that does not alter the CSS of your input.
